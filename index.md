# Data cleaning

Before working with the downloaded tweets, the data must be "cleaned". This means extracting the useful words of a tweet, and discarding the "rubbish" like emojis, stopwords (have, at, me, etc.), usernames, etc. (and those hated specially encoded characters from the deepest pits of hell like `˙¸˛). Of course every research find different words meaningful, so I will explain why I defined "rubbish" as I did.

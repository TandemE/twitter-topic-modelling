    "Due to the increasing volume of digitized text, the automatic classification and organization of written information becomes more and more important. The widely used tools to address this problem are topic models. These models originated from heuristic approaches, like singular value decomposition (SVD) in latent semantic indexing (LSI). The evolution of topic modelling continued in generative probabilistic models, two key developments are probabilistic LSI (pLSI) [#] and its continuation: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [#]. The latter was established as the state-of-the-art method, and was widely used for classification, recommendation, and even political analysis [#]."
